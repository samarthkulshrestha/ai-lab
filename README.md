Welcome to my journey of learning Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning
from the ground up. This repository documents my progress, notes, resources, and
projects as I build a foundational understanding of AI/ML.

### about this journey

I'm starting with fundamentals and working my way up to more advanced AI
concepts. This repository serves as both a personal learning log and a potential
resource for others on a similar path.

### resources

#### Courses:
1. MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra
2. MIT 18.02 Multivariable Calculus

#### Books:
1. Gilbert Strang's Introduction to Linear Algebra
2. Spivak's Calculus

### learning path

My planned learning path follows these major areas:

#### Mathematics:
1. Linear Algebra
2. Calculus
